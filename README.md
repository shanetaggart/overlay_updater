# overlay_updater

ðŸš§ Pardon the mess, this is a work in prgress! ðŸš§

This tool is statically built to assist in updating text and image files for use with Live Streaming software. It must be installed via a webserver or virtual webserver in order for the PHP to function, something like XAAMP or Local.

Currently the function of this tool fits my own personal needs, however, in the future I intend to convert this tool to use a non-server-side language, such as Python so that it may be installed and used easily. As well as refactoring the tool to use Object Oriented Programming in order to create a configuration object, which will be used to dynamically create the UI, as well as create and maintain any text and image files necessary. This would open this tool up to be easily used by anyone who needs it.

This project was born out of my creation of a local Super Smash Bros. community in my home town. After attending a big provincial tournament, it became clear that we were missing out in terms of having our own established community, and by having our tournament data saved in start.gg as well as live streaming our games. This tool enabled us to conduct our streams in an easier manner, without having to fuss with different software in order to keep our overlay updated at any given time.
